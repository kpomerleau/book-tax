Methodology for Estimating the Marginal Effective Tax Rate on New Investment Under Biden's Proposed Book Minimum Tax

The following is the methodology for estimating the marginal effective tax rate under Biden's proposal minimum tax on "book" income. The methodology is adapted from "Understanding Investment Incentives Under Parallel Tax Systems: An Application to the Alternative Minimum Tax" by Andrew B. Lyon (1989).

The method starts with the standard cost of capital formula from Jogensen (1967). The cost of capital is equal to the gross return needed to cover tax, depreciation, and the return demanded by shareholders.

where 'c' is the cost of capital, 'r' is the firm's real discount rate, 'delta' is economic depreciation, 'u' is the statutory tax rate, 'z' is the present discounted value of depreciation deductions, and 'k' is any investment tax credit.

This discount rate "r" is the weighted average rate for equity and debt-financed investment:

The standard formula assumes that tax policy is constant over the life of the asset. It does not consider the impact of rate or base changes the could occur. In order to account for that, the cost of capital formula is expanded to account for different tax rates and deductions in different periods.

As such, as such the value of deductions and the rate at which earnings are taxed are considered as a firm switches between the ordinary and parellel tax system.

Finally, the a firm that is subject to the parellel tax system generates tax credits for timing differences offset future ordinary tax liabiliy. There are two components of the credits: the difference in the tax a firm pays on earnings under the parellel system and the tax paid on earnings under the ordinary corporate tax.

"V" is equal to the difference between the tax value of deductions under the ordinary tax and the parellel tax system.

and "W" is the difference in the tax a firm pays on earnings under the parellel system and the tax paid on earnings under the ordinary corporate tax.

The final cost of capital formula is:
